# 🩺 Asteria AI

### Offline-First Intelligent Health Screening & Clinical Triage System

Asteria AI is an offline-first, multi-stage health screening and risk-assessment system designed for low-resource and rural healthcare settings, especially in India. It bridges the critical gap between early symptoms and formal clinical diagnosis using AI-assisted triage, not diagnosis.

---

## ⚠️ Medical Disclaimer

**Asteria AI is a clinical decision-support & triage tool, NOT a diagnostic system.**

- It helps assess risk, guide next actions, and encourage timely medical consultation.
- Always consult qualified healthcare professionals for medical decisions.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In rural and semi-urban regions:

- **Doctors and radiologists are often hours away**
- **Patients delay care** due to cost, distance, or uncertainty
- **Symptoms are ignored** until the disease becomes severe

Asteria AI enables early risk awareness — even without internet or imaging — and escalates care only when necessary.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📴 **Offline-First Design** - Works without internet
- 🧠 **GenAI-Powered Clinical Screening** - Local LLM
- 🫁 **Chest X-ray AI** - CNN-based analysis
- 🔥 **Explainability with Grad-CAM** - Visual interpretability
- 🔗 **Fusion Model** - Symptoms + Image combined
- ⚠️ **Uncertainty & Low-Confidence Handling** - Safety-first approach
- 📄 **Auto Referral Summary** for Doctors
- 🌐 **PWA-ready** for field health workers

## 🧪 Disease Focus (Hackathon-Optimized)

- **Tuberculosis (TB)**
- **Pneumonia**
- **Normal**

Chosen due to:
- High public-health impact
- X-ray availability
- Clear clinical escalation paths

---

## 🔍 ML & AI Design Principles

### 1️⃣ Symptom Intelligence (Stage 1 - LLM)

- **Powered by Local LLM**: Uses quantized models (e.g., Qwen/Llama) via Ollama for offline capability
- **Conversational Interface**: Conducts an empathetic, context-aware clinical interview in simple English
- **Dynamic Logic**: Adapts follow-up questions based on patient history (e.g., Demographics, previous answers)
- **Structured Extraction**: Converts natural language conversation into structured medical risk data

### 2️⃣ Imaging AI (CNN)

- Transfer learning (ResNet / EfficientNet)
- Trained on curated TB & Pneumonia datasets
- Outputs probability + heatmap

### 3️⃣ Explainability (Grad-CAM)

- Highlights lung regions
- Prevents false trust
- Helps doctors & health workers understand why

### 4️⃣ Fusion Engine (Core Innovation)

Combines:
- Symptom Score (from LLM)
- Image Probability (from CNN)

```
Final Risk = f(Symptom Score + Image Probability)
```

- More reliable than image-only AI
- Context-aware decision making

### 5️⃣ Uncertainty Handling (Critical)

- Low confidence → Safety warning
- Prevents unsafe automation bias

## 🌍 Real-World Impact

- 🏥 **Reduces unnecessary hospital visits**
- 👩‍⚕️ **Empowers ASHA & frontline workers**
- 🕒 **Enables early intervention**
- 🌐 **Designed for regional language adaptation**

---

## ⚖️ Ethics & Safety

- ✅ No automated diagnosis
- ✅ Clear confidence thresholds
- ✅ Explicit referral guidance
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop philosophy

---

## 🌍 Why Asteria AI?

In rural India, the nearest radiologist might be hours away. Asteria AI empowers ASHA workers and frontline staff to:

- **Reduce unnecessary travel**: Patients only travel to district hospitals if the risk is High
- **Empower Health Workers**: Provides a digital "second opinion" where no doctors exist
- **Language Friendly**: Designed to be adapted into regional languages for better accessibility
